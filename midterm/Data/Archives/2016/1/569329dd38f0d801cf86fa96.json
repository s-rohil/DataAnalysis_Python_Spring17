The Checkerboard Film Foundation is very saddened at the passing of Ellsworth Kelly, seminal artist and true gentleman.

He said: \"In my paintings, I am not inventing; my ideas come from constantly investigating how things look.\" They included the shadows of an arch of a bridge on the Seine (\"White Plaque: Bridge Arch and Reflection,\" 1951-55); the external chimneys on the wall of a building (\"Ormesson,\" 1950); and the long angular windows at The Museum of Modern Art, Paris (\"Window,\" his first panel painting, 1949).
