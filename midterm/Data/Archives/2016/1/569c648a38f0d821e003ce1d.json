His name was Wiliam Joseph Hochswender III, but everyone knew him as Woody. For many, he was the lanky, redheaded and perennially boyish fashion and style reporter for The New York Times, Harper's Bazaar, Esquire and Golf. For others, he was an inspirational practitioner of Nichiren Buddhism: he brought comfort, joy and wisdom to many through his example, his guidance and his two books, \"The Buddha in Your Mirror\" and \"The Buddha in Your Rearview Mirror.\" In Sharon, CT, where he had lived since 1993, he was known as a quirky character with memorable pickup trucks (his beautiful golden retriever, Lola, nearly always along for the ride) and a passion for swimming, biking and otherwise enjoying the beauty around him. For his daughter, Kate, he was her biggest cheerleader as well as the person who always encouraged her to set a high standard and then meet it. He adored her, and she adored him. A true journalist, Woody was interested in everything; for the past few years, he was able to travel widely and meet interesting people in the company of his girlfriend, Kirsten Jensen. His daughter and former wife, Cynthia, were glad that he was able to enrich his life and expand his horizons with Kirsten before his death, from a glioblastoma tumor, on December 31.
