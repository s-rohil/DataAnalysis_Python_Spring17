With infinite sadness, the Board and staff of Playwrights Horizons note the death of Norman Peck. Our theater's relationship with Norman began as a professional one - funder-to-grantee - but almost immediately, the president of the Peter J. Sharp Foundation (whose wise philanthropy changed our theater and our city for the better in countless ways) became a true friend. A man of great intelligence, vision, taste, kindness and humor, his care and concern for Playwrights Horizons never wavered from the first moment of our first meeting, and our affection and high regard for this exceptional man grew with the years. We send our deepest sympathy to his wife, Liliane, his children and grandchildren. Norman will be missed by us and by so many others. Judith O.
