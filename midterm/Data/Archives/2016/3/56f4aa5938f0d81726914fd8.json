Dearest Dad, it's been an unfathomable heartbreaking 20 years. There are no words to express how painful & devastating losing you has been. There is a grief that cannot be described. There was no better human being than you. \"Man is honored for his wisdom, love for his kindness,\" that was you. No daughter could have loved or cared about a father more than me. My heart breaks for what you have missed out in life & for not having a longer life. Time has not eased the pain in losing you. Not a day goes by that I don't think about you. Why you had to die so young & fast is incomprehensible. My sadness never leaves me. The only comfort is knowing you are with mom, Irving, grandma & Niblets. May God let me find you again.
