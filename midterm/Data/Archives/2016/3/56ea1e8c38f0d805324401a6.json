Devoted husband and best friend of Pamela Poppalardo. Adoring father of Simon and Madeleine. Cousin of Earl Wasserman and Eileen Corbin. Beloved brother-in-law of Jacqueline and Wayne and fond \"uncle\" to their children and grandchildren. A highly dedicated psychologist in Ridgewood, N.J., Dr. Gaines initiated the Anxiety Disorders Program at West Bergen Mental Healthcare, where he continued in a training and consulting role until very recently.
