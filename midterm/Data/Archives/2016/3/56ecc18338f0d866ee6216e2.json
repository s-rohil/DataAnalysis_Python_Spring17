Beneath his gruff exterior, John was an amazingly warm, kind, compassionate, generous, and sympathetic human being. His horizon extended far beyond the world of finance; he was a true intellect, loving husband and father, a real Renaissance man. My wife Dalia and I extend our sympathy and send our love to Susan, Nick, Owen, Josh, and JP. We will always miss him.
