It is with profound sorrow that I mourn the loss of my dear friend, Carolyn Lanchner. She was a hard-working, astute historian of the key figures of modern art; her many Museum of Modern Art exhibitions and publications reflect her deep, unaffected erudition no less than her sensitivity to the past's pertinence and connection to contemporary art. An over 30-year and particularly beloved member of the MoMA staff, she also had an enviable personal life. Self-effacing and possessed of an endearingly wry sense of humor, piercingly honest yet always empathetic, her personal qualities are as indelible as her professional achievements. My condolences to the family and many friends of a marvelous and wise woman, whom I will greatly miss. Agnes Gund 1/3", "source": "The New York Times", "lead_paragraph": "LANCHNER--Carolyn.
