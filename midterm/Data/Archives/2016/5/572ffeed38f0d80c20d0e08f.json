He was 90. A Veteran of World War II, Dr. Donn went on to study at Yale and Columbia, where he later served as the Harkness Professor of Ophthalmology, Department Chairman and Director of the Edward S. Harkness Eye Institute. In 1955, he travelled to England for postgraduate work in corneal physiology at the Institute of Ophthalmology, London, as assistant to the Queen's Ophthalmologist, Sir Stewart Duke-Elder. Specializing in diseases of the cornea, Dr. Donn pioneered the development of now routine techniques, including intraocular lens implantation following cataract surgery and specular microscopy to monitor the endothelial cells lining the back of the cornea with David Maurice, Ph.D. He earned international recognition for Columbia's corneal research program, leading to major funding from the National Institutes for Health in 1964 for a Corneal Center. After his retirement, the Anthony Donn Professorship in Ophthalmic Science was endowed in his honor to recognize his half century of contributions to Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons. He is survived by his wife Linda, children Michael and his wife Gulbahar, son Alex and his wife Anat and daughter Cassin and her husband Geoffrey and grandchildren Aliya, Ashraf, Phoebe, Amos and Barnaby. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests that memorial contributions be made to the Northeast Vermont Regional Hospital. 1/3", "source": "The New York Times", "lead_paragraph": "DONN-- Anthony, M.D. Died April 22nd in East Burke, VT.
