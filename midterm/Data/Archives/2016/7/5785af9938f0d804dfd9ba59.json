With profound sadness, the staff and board of American Jewish World Service (AJWS) mourn the loss of Elie Wiesel, Holocaust survivor, Nobel laureate, tireless advocate for human rights and a founding member of our board. Wiesel helped establish AJWS thirty years ago, sharing our deep belief that the lessons of the Holocaust demand that Jews and others stand up against injustice for oppressed people everywhere. We extend our condolences to his entire family. May his memory be a call to action for human rights.
