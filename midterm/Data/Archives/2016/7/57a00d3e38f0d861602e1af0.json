Beloved sister of Jay Paul and treasured by her many friends, passed away at her home in Rye, NY on July 19th. Born in Montreal, she graduated from Denison University and began an advertising career with Young and Rubicam Inc. in Manhattan and remained there until her retirement in the TV department. A longtime member of the Westchester Country Club, she was particularly active with and honored by St. Vincent's Hospital Harrison in 2008. Her fun and charm will be missed by all who knew her. Family will receive friends at the Graham Funeral Home in Rye, NY on Wednesday, July 27th at 9:30am. A Mass of Christian Burial will follow at 11:30am at the Church of the Resurrection.
