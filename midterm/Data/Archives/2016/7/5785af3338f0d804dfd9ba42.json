The American Society for Yad Vashem mourns the passing of its Honorary Chairman, Elie Wiesel. Born in Romania before WWII, he was deported as a teenager to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Elie survived the horrors of the concentration camp to become the pre- eminent voice of Holocaust education and remembrance. His teachings, writings and lectures demanded that the world remain vigilant in the face of \"moral indifference, intolerance and injustice\". He was a tireless advocate for the six million souls who lost their voices in the Shoah. His message that we must never forget is the clarion call of the American Society for Yad Vashem. Our heartfelt condolences to his wife Marion, his son Elisha, his stepdaughter Jennifer Rose and his two grandchildren. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Leonard Wilf, Chairman Ron Meier, Executive Director 1/3", "word_count": "140", "pub_date": "2016-07-05T00:00:00Z", "subsection_name": null, "blog": [], "type_of_material": "Paid Death Notice", "section_name": "Paid Death Notices", "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0DC113AF936A35754C0A9609D8B63", "_id": "5785af3338f0d804dfd9ba42"}
