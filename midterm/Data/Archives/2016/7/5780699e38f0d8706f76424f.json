Reggie died overlooking the gardens she ardently tended and the Great South Bay, two of her favorite places. Reggie was a dynamo. Born in Poland in 1929, she immigrated to New York where she lived the American Dream. She married Stanley and had two children. Early on, she was a school librarian. Later she was elected to the Brookhaven Town Council. For a third career, she became a lawyer. She worked pro-bono protecting the environment and challenging questionable governmental actions. She was an expert on the law of standing. She ran for Congress defeating the incumbent in the Primary, but losing in the General Election. Her passions included gardening, tennis, sculpting, walking, cross country skiing, birding, and writing a mystery novel about Benedict Arnold. Reggie is survived by her son Eric, his wife Nealle, her granddaughters Veronica Jean and Bryn, and innumerable friends. 1/3", "word_count": "145", "pub_date": "2016-07-01T00:00:00Z", "subsection_name": null, "blog": [], "type_of_material": "Paid Death Notice", "section_name": "Paid Death Notices", "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901EEDE113AF932A35754C0A9609D8B63", "_id": "5780699e38f0d8706f76424f"}
