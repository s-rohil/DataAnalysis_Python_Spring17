Born in Brooklyn, New York, on August 28, 1920 to Louis and Ann Horowitz, Bertha was a force to be reckoned with. She was strong, independent, had a wicked sense of humor, and always spoke her mind. She received her bachelor's degree in English and Anthropology from Hunter College in 1942. Later she went on to work for the Associated Press until she met Albert Blanck whom she married in 1945. Bertha loved books, reading, and collecting complimentary items from restaurants such as napkins, rolls, and condiment packets. She will be missed and remembered by her three children, Richard, Carol, and Peter, her eight grandchildren, David, Jennifer, Emily, Steven, Jason, Daniel, Albert, and Caroline, and her three great-grandchildren, Molly, Colin, and Rory. 1/3", "word_count": "135", "pub_date": "2016-07-15T00:00:00Z", "subsection_name": null, "blog": [], "type_of_material": "Paid Death Notice", "section_name": "Paid Death Notices", "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E7D7113AF936A25754C0A9609D8B63", "_id": "5792deb838f0d81cba92520a"}
