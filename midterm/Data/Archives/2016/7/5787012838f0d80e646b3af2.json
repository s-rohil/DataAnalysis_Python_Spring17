On July 3, 2016, Lawrence Ruben, a longtime member of the Board of Overseers of Benjamin N. Cardozo Law School, passed away at the age of 90. He is survived by his wife, Jan; his children Richard, Lenore, Shelley and Amy; and nine grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. He was Chairman of Ruben Companies, an organization renowned worldwide for its work in real estate investment, development and management. When Larry came on the Board of Cardozo, it was a fledgling law school. His vision and openhearted generosity were significant in setting Cardozo on its trajectory of excellence. We are deeply grateful. May his family be comforted among all who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M.
