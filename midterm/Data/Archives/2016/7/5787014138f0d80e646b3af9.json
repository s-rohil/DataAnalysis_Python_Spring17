The board and staff of City Parks Foundation mourn the loss of founding secretary of the board and trustee emeritus Roscoe Brown. Brown, who served on our board for more than 25 years, was a thoughtful and dedicated member who helped ensure that small, neighborhood parks around our city received needed support. A Tuskegee Airman, decorated World War II hero, Congressional Gold Medal recipient, educator and professor, and nine-time NYC marathon runner. Roscoe was generous, humble and honorable. He was a great friend to City Parks Foundation and we will miss him. Our deepest condolences to Roscoe's children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. John Troubh, Chairman Jean Troubh & David Moore, Executive Chairmen Bruce Ratner, Honorary Chair Andrew Tisch, Chairman Emeritus Heather Lubov, Executive Director 1/3", "word_count": "126", "pub_date": "2016-07-06T00:00:00Z", "subsection_name": null, "blog": [], "type_of_material": "Paid Death Notice", "section_name": "Paid Death Notices", "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE4DB113AF935A35754C0A9609D8B63", "_id": "5787014138f0d80e646b3af9"}
