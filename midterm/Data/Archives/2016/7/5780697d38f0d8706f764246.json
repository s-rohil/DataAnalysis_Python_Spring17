The Board of Trustees, the clergy, staff and members of Congregation Habonim mourn the untimely death of longtime member Linda Goldstein. Our hearts go out to her husband Neil, President of Habonim, and daughter Sara Mairs, whose recent marriage to Russell Mairs brought so much happiness to Linda and Neil. Linda, who lived life to the fullest, brought light, joy and compassion to her family, friends and her congregation. Neil was a constant loving presence during her life as well as these last few months. Our admiration and gratitude go to him for continuing to lead our congregation during these difficult days.
