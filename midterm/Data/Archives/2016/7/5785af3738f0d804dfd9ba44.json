Citizens Union mourns the passing of Ogden (\"Denny\") Lewis, its former Chair (1997-2003) and board member for 24 years. Our condolences to his wife of 42 years, Susan, his family and his many friends and admirers. There was no kinder a man, no more precise a mind, no more caring a person, no more pleasingly warm a writer, no more attentive a listener, and no more humbler a person. He was an inspirational leader of great warmth, humility and sense of purpose who invested mightily in Citizens Union and guided us to a place where it could reach levels of activity and influence it had not previously known. Under his leadership, Citizens Union started its publication, www.GothamGazette.com. We will miss his gentle guidance, humor and abiding humanity. Peter Sherwin, Board Chair; Bob Abrams, Foundation President; Dick Dadey, Executive Director 1/3", "word_count": "141", "pub_date": "2016-07-05T00:00:00Z", "subsection_name": null, "blog": [], "type_of_material": "Paid Death Notice", "section_name": "Paid Death Notices", "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE1DC113AF936A35754C0A9609D8B63", "_id": "5785af3738f0d804dfd9ba44"}
