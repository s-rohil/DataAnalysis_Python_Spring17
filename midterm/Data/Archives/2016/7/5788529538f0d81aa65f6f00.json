The Jewish Community Relations Council of New York mourns the loss of Elie Wiesel. A cherished friend and a man of impeccable integrity and conscience, he spoke out at many of our important events, vigils, rallies and demonstrations for justice, human rights, and peace. As a witness to and survivor of the Holocaust, Elie's haunting and poignant books and other writings gave voice to the murdered six million Jewish victims. Although the author of \"The Jews of Silence\" has now been silenced, his precious legacy of remembrance for all victims of indifference carries forward.
