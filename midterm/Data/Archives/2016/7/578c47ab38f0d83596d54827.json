She was married to Philip Crandon Woodyatt. She worked all her life at the Dalton School, the Anne Andrews Employment Agency, as personal assistant to Dr. Benjamin Spock, at the National Academy of Design and at the Cooper Hewitt Design Museum. Her favorite was working in radio news during the war. Lois was a world traveler and the beloved friend of many, a wide community of admirers whose lives were enriched by her wisdom and biting wit. Her stories were better than anyone's but when she talked to you, it was about you, never herself. Her daughters, Rolly and Rachel; her son-in-law Emilio; her grandchildren, William, Abigail, Catherine, and Alessia; her grand-son-in-law, Felice; and her great-grandchildren Gabriele and Anna join all her friends in thanking her for sharing her wonderful life with us. 1/3", "word_count": "143", "pub_date": "2016-07-10T00:00:00Z", "subsection_name": null, "blog": [], "type_of_material": "Paid Death Notice", "section_name": "Paid Death Notices", "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00EED9113AF933A25754C0A9609D8B63", "_id": "578c47ab38f0d83596d54827"}
