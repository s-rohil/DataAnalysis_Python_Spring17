Age 78, passed away in New York City on July 2, 2016, at home with her beloved husband of 60 years Dr. Stuart R. Edelson. The daughter of the late Bertha Cohen and Murray Fahrie, Phyllis Merle Fahrie was born on October 25, 1937 in the Bronx, New York. After receiving her Ph.D. in English from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, Phyllis devoted her life to teaching.
