Brown, Jr., Ph.D. Dr. Brown was a longtime and active member of our Board of Trustees, particularly during his years as President of Bronx Community College. A steadfast member of the Botanical Garden family, he always stood at the ready to help in any way he could. His thrilling presentation at the Garden about his career as a Tuskegee Airman will ever remain a cherished memory for the community. We extend our sincere condolences to his family. Maureen K.
