The staff and board of the Metropolitan Opera Guild are profoundly saddened by the loss of our dear friend and colleague, Stewart Pearce. Stewart worked at the Guild and the Metropolitan Opera from 1976 until his retirement in 2015, and in the last five years of his career served as the Guild's Managing Director. He was a devoted opera fan as well as a savvy businessman, a caring, calm and thoughtful presence in an often tumultuous world. We will miss his unfailing humor, wisdom and strength, and send our deepest condolences to his husband, Kevin Kellogg. 1/3", "word_count": "98", "pub_date": "2016-07-19T00:00:00Z", "subsection_name": null, "blog": [], "type_of_material": "Paid Death Notice", "section_name": "Paid Death Notices", "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E1D6113AF93AA25754C0A9609D8B63", "_id": "5798241d38f0d860009228f8"}
