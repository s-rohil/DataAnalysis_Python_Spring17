### Feedback:
- Nice work! Need to read requirements carefully next time.
- Question 5: We want words NOT in common_list.
- Question 6: Merge the file first, then set words unique. Otherwise, you can not remove the same words which is redundant in two files. What you put in words dictionary is the last file you count. 
- Question 7: Requirement is name end with 26 character not start with.
